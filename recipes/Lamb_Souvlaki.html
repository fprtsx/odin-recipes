    <h1>Lamb Souvlaki</h1>
    <img src="Images/Lamb_Souvlaki.jpg" alt="Lamb Souvlaki">
    <p>Souvlaki is marinated pork, chicken, beef, or lamb grilled on a skewer. It's typically served on a skewer, but you can also eat it in a warm pita or over salad. Gyros are made with stacked meat (usually pork, but other meats are common) that has been cooked on a vertical rotisserie.</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, oregano, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Add cubed lamb and stir until lamb is coated with marinade. Cover and refrigerate 3 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Thread marinated lamb onto skewers, reserving any remaining marinade. Grill skewers until desired doneness, 10 to 12 minutes, basting with the reserved marinade and turning occasionally for even cooking.</li>
    </ol>
